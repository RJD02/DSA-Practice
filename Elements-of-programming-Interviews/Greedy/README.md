# Greedy Algorithm
It's an algorithm that computes a solution in steps; at each step the algorithm makes a decision that is locally optimum , and it never changess that decision

# Tips
* A greedy algo is often the right choice for an optimization problem where there's a natural set of choices to select from
* It's often easier to conceptualize a greedy algo recursively, and then implement it using iteration for higher performance
* Even if the greedy approach does not yield an optimum solution, it can give insights into the optimum algo, or serve as a heuristic
* Sometimes the right greedy choice is not obvious
